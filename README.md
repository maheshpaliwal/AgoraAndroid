# AgoraAndroid
My prototype for agora android application using kotlin

Through my app I have tried to maintain a seamless user experience thus maintaining consistency with the Agora-vote website. With close attention to detail, I have incorporated every functionality available on the website at users's fingertips including the design, color and gradient.
